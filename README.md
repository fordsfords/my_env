# my_env

Just a collection of files that implement my preferred environment.
Not particularly for public consumption.

Except where specifically called out, files with names that start with
upper-case and switch to lower-case were originally named with a leading
dot and all lower-case to make them somewhat invisible. So, for example,
the repo file "Bashrc" was originally ".bashrc".
